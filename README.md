# Color_Palette_Generator
 
This project generates a customizable color palette from a collection of input images. 
The user uploads an image collection and the color palette generator samples colors from the collection and ranks colors by their level of dominance (frequency of occurrence) acres the image collection. 
The color data is fed into a browser hosted user interface where the user can customize and download their unique color palette.
